Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Logistic Regression

Exercise Summary 

This project implements logistic regression from scratch to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data. The notebook covers the full machine learning workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and normalization
Logistic regression implementation (without scikit-learn)
Model training and evaluation
Decision boundary visualization
L2 regularization analysis
Deployment exploration using Amazon SageMaker
The goal is to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical application of logistic regression in a real-world healthcare context.
